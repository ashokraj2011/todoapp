# {{work.id}} — Mobile Visual Comparison

## Approved references and implementation

{{inputs}}

## Verification environment

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Source commit/tree hash | TODO |
| Platform/framework | TODO |
| Build configuration | TODO |
| Simulator/emulator devices | TODO |
| Locale, theme, text scale | TODO |
| Capture and comparison commands | TODO |
| Pixel/visual difference | TODO: record a numeric percentage, for example `Pixel diff: 1.8% — matched within threshold` |

## Screen comparison

| Screen/state | Design reference | App screenshot | Overlay/diff | Functional result | Visual result | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SCREEN-001 | DOC-nnn / path | TODO | TODO | pass/fail | TODO | matched/partial/missing/deviated |

Store implementation screenshots and pixelmatch/overlay diff images inside `artifacts/visual-verification/evidence/`. Use descriptive names such as `checkout-actual.png` and `checkout-pixelmatch-diff.png`. `singularity-flow phase publish visual-verification` automatically registers, hashes, commits, and pushes every changed file under this phase directory.

The desktop Review page presents the pinned design export, implementation screenshot, and diff evidence in side-by-side, overlay-slider, and diff-highlight modes. Approval is always against the pinned design hash, not the live Figma URL.

## Design-system and accessibility checks

| Check | Command/method | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Component/token reuse | TODO | pass/fail | TODO |
| Semantic accessibility | TODO | pass/fail | TODO |
| Text scaling/localization | TODO | pass/fail | TODO |
| Keyboard/insets/orientation | TODO | pass/fail | TODO |

## Differences and dispositions

| Difference ID | Screen/spec | Observation | Severity | Fix/deviation | Approver |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DIFF-001 | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

## Conclusion

TODO: State which flows are visually and functionally ready, which remain partial or blocked, and whether designer and QA approval is recommended.
