# test-101 — Implementation Summary

## Agent brief

<!--
Summarize the implemented outcome, consequential decisions, changed surfaces, validation result,
remaining limitations, and rollout considerations for downstream agents. Keep it evidence-based;
the detailed changed-components and test sections are preserved separately.
-->

Implemented a local-state calendar inside the Todo app with month, week, and day views, date navigation, and create, edit, and delete flows for Todo tasks and general events. The calendar keeps both item types visible in each applicable view and preserves the existing task completion checkbox behavior. The interface is responsive and was inspected in a local browser. Automated UI tests, the production build, and lint all pass. The screenshot is saved at the approved evidence path; human visual review remains separate. Items remain in component state and are not persisted across reloads; Google Calendar synchronization, recurrence, and unspecified time semantics remain out of scope.

## Implemented outcome

Month, week, and day views render Todo tasks and general events using local calendar dates. Users can navigate the calendar, create either item type, edit its title/type/date, delete it, and mark Todo tasks complete.

## Changed components and decisions

`src/App.jsx` implements the item model, local-date navigation, all three views, and item management. Its clause comments bind the view display to `@clause:TEST-101:REQ-001`, creation to `@clause:TEST-101:REQ-002`, editing to `@clause:TEST-101:REQ-003`, and deletion to `@clause:TEST-101:REQ-004`. `src/App.css` supplies the calendar layout, responsive styles, and root overrides for the starter page defaults; `src/App.test.jsx` covers display, create, edit, and delete interactions for both item types. `package.json` and `package-lock.json` add the planned Vitest and DOM testing dependencies. No production dependency, persistence layer, migration, or external calendar integration was added. The production build and lint completed successfully.

## Tests and operational notes

`npm test` — passed, 1 test file and 4 UI tests. Coverage checks both item types in month, week, and day views and exercises create, edit, and delete interactions. `npm run build` — passed. `npm run lint` — passed. These were local development checks, not a governed publication test run. The first publication test attempt failed because the candidate did not include `vite.config.js`, leaving the DOM environment unset; the test file now declares its jsdom environment directly. The governed publication retry must establish fresh passing results. The screenshot for `TEST-101:AC-001` is saved at `singularity/work-items/test-101/evidence/calendar-ui.png`; it is evidence for human review, not a visual pass. Items are in-memory only and use local calendar dates; persistence, recurrence, and timezone guarantees are not implemented.

## Summary from “Agent brief”

Add an in-app calendar to the Todo application with a Google Calendar-like interface. It shows
Todo tasks and general calendar events in month, week, and day views. A Todo app user can create,
view, edit, and delete both kinds of items. A screenshot of the completed UI is required.
Google Calendar synchronization and visual matching to an external reference are not part of the
confirmed request.

## Actors

The Todo app user views and manages Todo tasks and general calendar events in the in-app calendar.
No other roles or permission distinctions were specified.

## User scenarios

### S1 — See tasks and events in the calendar

**Priority:** P1
**Actor:** Todo app user
**Context:** The in-app calendar is available and may contain tasks, general events, or no items.

- **Given** Todo tasks and general calendar events exist
  **When** the user opens the month view
  **Then** the calendar displays both kinds of items in that view.

- **Given** Todo tasks and general calendar events exist
  **When** the user opens the week view
  **Then** the calendar displays both kinds of items in that view.

- **Given** Todo tasks and general calendar events exist
  **When** the user opens the day view
  **Then** the calendar displays both kinds of items in that view.

### S2 — Manage calendar items

**Priority:** P2
**Actor:** Todo app user
**Context:** The user is using the in-app calendar.

- **Given** the calendar is open
  **When** the user creates a Todo task or general calendar event
  **Then** the new item can be viewed in the calendar.

- **Given** a Todo task or general calendar event exists
  **When** the user edits it in the calendar
  **Then** the updated item can be viewed in the calendar.

- **Given** a Todo task or general calendar event exists
  **When** the user deletes it in the calendar
  **Then** the deleted item is no longer displayed in the calendar.

### S3 — Provide visual evidence

**Priority:** P3
**Actor:** Todo app user
**Context:** The in-app calendar UI has been completed.

- **Given** the completed calendar UI
  **When** acceptance evidence is provided
  **Then** a screenshot of the completed UI is delivered.

## Failure and empty states

- **Empty:** No special empty-state behavior or wording was specified; the request does not define
  what the calendar displays when it has no items.
- **Failure:** No failure behavior was specified. The confirmed in-app interpretation does not
  request Google Calendar synchronization or another external calendar dependency.
- **Partial:** No behavior for partially completed create, edit, or delete operations was specified.

## Permissions

The Todo app user can view and manage the two specified item types. The request defines no
additional roles, access rules, or behavior for users with different permissions.

## Boundary conditions

The required calendar views are month, week, and day. No limits, date-range rules, recurrence,
timezone behavior, or other boundary conditions were specified.

## Requirements

- The in-app calendar displays both Todo tasks and general calendar events in month, week, and day
  views. *(S1)* [TEST-101:REQ-001]
- The Todo app user can create Todo tasks and general calendar events in the in-app calendar.
  *(S2)* [TEST-101:REQ-002]
- The Todo app user can edit Todo tasks and general calendar events in the in-app calendar.
  *(S2)* [TEST-101:REQ-003]
- The Todo app user can delete Todo tasks and general calendar events in the in-app calendar.
  *(S2)* [TEST-101:REQ-004]
- A screenshot of the completed calendar UI is delivered as acceptance evidence
  [scope:SRI-35efa5d9d09b]. *(S3)* [TEST-101:AC-001]

## Non-functional requirements

No non-functional requirements were specified.

## Assumptions

The confirmed phrase “Google Calendar-like” means an in-app calendar interface, not synchronization
with Google Calendar. The requested screenshot is a final UI deliverable, not a comparison against a
reference image. The request does not settle event fields, date/time semantics, recurrence, reminders,
or persistence behavior; no requirements for those details are inferred here.

## Out of scope

Google Calendar synchronization is outside the confirmed in-app interface request. No additional
calendar features or implementation-specific visual matching are committed by the available sources.

## Summary from “Agent brief”

Extend the existing React Todo screen into a single in-app calendar backed by local component state. Preserve Todo items while adding general calendar events, date navigation, and month/week/day views; provide create, edit, and delete actions for each item type. Keep Google Calendar synchronization, persistence, recurrence, and unspecified date/time semantics out of scope. Prove the five functional obligations with focused UI tests and deliver the required screenshot as separate Story evidence after implementation.

## Test strategy

Add a focused UI test file and configure the existing Vite project to run it with Vitest and a DOM testing environment. Exercise both Todo and general-event data through visible user interactions, including each calendar view and each mutation. Run the focused tests and `npm run build`; these commands are verification, not substitutes for the retained screenshot. Capture the final calendar screenshot during implementation and copy it once to the Story evidence path; inspect that image as the visual proof. The screenshot is not an executable test output and must not be overwritten by later test runs.

| Clause | Expected paths | Planned tests | Fulfillment | Observable result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `TEST-101:AC-001` | `singularity/work-items/test-101/evidence/calendar-ui.png` | verification: TEST-101:AC-001 | evidence | A retained screenshot shows the completed in-app calendar UI. |
| `TEST-101:REQ-001` | `src/App.jsx` `src/App.css` | `src/App.test.jsx` | modified | Both Todo tasks and general events are visible in month, week, and day views. |
| `TEST-101:REQ-002` | `src/App.jsx` `src/App.css` | `src/App.test.jsx` | modified | The user can create a Todo task and a general event, and each appears in the calendar. |
| `TEST-101:REQ-003` | `src/App.jsx` `src/App.css` | `src/App.test.jsx` | modified | The user can edit a Todo task and a general event, and each updated item appears in the calendar. |
| `TEST-101:REQ-004` | `src/App.jsx` `src/App.css` | `src/App.test.jsx` | modified | The user can delete a Todo task and a general event, and neither remains displayed. |

## Risks and rollback

The existing app is a small in-memory Todo scaffold with no established test suite; introducing test tooling adds dependency and maintenance cost. Keep the test setup limited to the UI behaviors in this plan and verify it with the focused test command and production build. A shared item model or date-range calculation could omit items at view boundaries; test both item types across all three views. Because persistence and date/time semantics are unspecified, items may reset on reload and dates should use a consistent local interpretation without claiming timezone guarantees. If the calendar changes regress the existing Todo flow or cannot be verified, revert only the calendar-related UI, styling, and test-tooling changes while preserving the original Todo behavior; do not alter approved specification inputs.
