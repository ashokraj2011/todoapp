## Summary from “Agent brief”

Add an in-app calendar to the Todo application with a Google Calendar-like interface. It shows
Todo tasks and general calendar events in month, week, and day views. A Todo app user can create,
view, edit, and delete both kinds of items. A screenshot of the completed UI is required.
Google Calendar synchronization and visual matching to an external reference are not part of the
confirmed request.

## Actors

The Todo app user views and manages Todo tasks and general calendar events in the in-app calendar.
No other roles or permission distinctions were specified.

## User scenarios

### S1 — See tasks and events in the calendar

**Priority:** P1
**Actor:** Todo app user
**Context:** The in-app calendar is available and may contain tasks, general events, or no items.

- **Given** Todo tasks and general calendar events exist
  **When** the user opens the month view
  **Then** the calendar displays both kinds of items in that view.

- **Given** Todo tasks and general calendar events exist
  **When** the user opens the week view
  **Then** the calendar displays both kinds of items in that view.

- **Given** Todo tasks and general calendar events exist
  **When** the user opens the day view
  **Then** the calendar displays both kinds of items in that view.

### S2 — Manage calendar items

**Priority:** P2
**Actor:** Todo app user
**Context:** The user is using the in-app calendar.

- **Given** the calendar is open
  **When** the user creates a Todo task or general calendar event
  **Then** the new item can be viewed in the calendar.

- **Given** a Todo task or general calendar event exists
  **When** the user edits it in the calendar
  **Then** the updated item can be viewed in the calendar.

- **Given** a Todo task or general calendar event exists
  **When** the user deletes it in the calendar
  **Then** the deleted item is no longer displayed in the calendar.

### S3 — Provide visual evidence

**Priority:** P3
**Actor:** Todo app user
**Context:** The in-app calendar UI has been completed.

- **Given** the completed calendar UI
  **When** acceptance evidence is provided
  **Then** a screenshot of the completed UI is delivered.

## Failure and empty states

- **Empty:** No special empty-state behavior or wording was specified; the request does not define
  what the calendar displays when it has no items.
- **Failure:** No failure behavior was specified. The confirmed in-app interpretation does not
  request Google Calendar synchronization or another external calendar dependency.
- **Partial:** No behavior for partially completed create, edit, or delete operations was specified.

## Permissions

The Todo app user can view and manage the two specified item types. The request defines no
additional roles, access rules, or behavior for users with different permissions.

## Boundary conditions

The required calendar views are month, week, and day. No limits, date-range rules, recurrence,
timezone behavior, or other boundary conditions were specified.

## Requirements

- The in-app calendar displays both Todo tasks and general calendar events in month, week, and day
  views. *(S1)* [TEST-101:REQ-001]
- The Todo app user can create Todo tasks and general calendar events in the in-app calendar.
  *(S2)* [TEST-101:REQ-002]
- The Todo app user can edit Todo tasks and general calendar events in the in-app calendar.
  *(S2)* [TEST-101:REQ-003]
- The Todo app user can delete Todo tasks and general calendar events in the in-app calendar.
  *(S2)* [TEST-101:REQ-004]
- A screenshot of the completed calendar UI is delivered as acceptance evidence
  [scope:SRI-35efa5d9d09b]. *(S3)* [TEST-101:AC-001]

## Non-functional requirements

No non-functional requirements were specified.

## Assumptions

The confirmed phrase “Google Calendar-like” means an in-app calendar interface, not synchronization
with Google Calendar. The requested screenshot is a final UI deliverable, not a comparison against a
reference image. The request does not settle event fields, date/time semantics, recurrence, reminders,
or persistence behavior; no requirements for those details are inferred here.

## Out of scope

Google Calendar synchronization is outside the confirmed in-app interface request. No additional
calendar features or implementation-specific visual matching are committed by the available sources.
